### Learning: key concepts
- Supervised, unsupervised and selfsupervised learning (definition and key examples).
- Supervised Learning (Probablly Approximate Learning)
-- Training and testing (theory of generalization, generalization bound, generalization tradeoff, bias-variance tradeoff, and learning curves).
-- Linear model (linear regression, logistic regression).
-- Overfitting (regularization and validation techniques).
-- Learning principles (Ocam's Razor, sampling bias, data snooping).
